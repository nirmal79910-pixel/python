I need you to build a complete, multi-page Web Application using Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. This app will serve as a portfolio piece to be shared on LinkedIn, so the User Interface must be modern, responsive, interactive, and visually stunning.

**Project Structure:**
Create a main landing page that introduces the application and provides navigation to three distinct tools.

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (use a modern framework like Tailwind CSS or custom high-quality CSS), and JavaScript for interactivity.
- Design Style: Modern, clean, "Dark Mode" aesthetic or a professional color palette. Use nice typography and hover effects.

**The Three Tools (Requirements):**

1. **BMI Calculator:**
   - Inputs: Weight (kg) and Height (cm/m).
   - Logic: Calculate BMI using the standard formula.
   - Output: Display the BMI score and the category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).
   - UI: Use a card-based layout. When the result is shown, use color coding (e.g., Green for Normal, Red for Obese).

2. **Life in Weeks Program:**
   - Inputs: Current Age or Date of Birth.
   - Logic: Assume a lifespan of 90 years. Calculate how many weeks the user has lived and how many weeks they have left.
   - UI: Create a visual representation (like a progress bar or a dynamic grid) showing "Weeks Used" vs "Weeks Left". It should look impactful to remind the user to value their time.

3. **Password Generator:**
   - Inputs: Desired Length (slider 8-32), Checkboxes for "Include Numbers", "Include Symbols", "Include Uppercase".
   - Logic: Generate a secure random password in Python based on the selected criteria.
   - UI: A clean input interface with a large display for the generated password and a "Copy to Clipboard" button.

**Additional Features:**
- A navigation bar that is present on all pages.
- A "Home" button to return to the landing page.
- Make sure the app is mobile-responsive.

Please write the full code, including the Flask routes (`app.py`) and the HTML templates. Ensure the app runs without errors.
